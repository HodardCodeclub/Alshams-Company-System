# Alshams-Company-System
# short Description

It was a Software Engineering course project. We were a team of 4 software engineers. Our project focuses on managing the construction department, technical department, logistic department, financial department and administration department. It was developed using object oriented php applying MVC and some different design patterns includes (observer, Decorative, singleton and factory ). We also used AJAX, JQuery, bootstrap and mysql workbench for mysql DB. The documentation of SRS & SDD was developed using latex. The web application was developed using agile software development method, so itâ€™s dynamic and reusable for other purposes.
